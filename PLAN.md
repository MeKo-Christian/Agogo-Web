# Implementation Plan: Photoshop/Photopea Clone (Agogo Web Editor)

> **Architecture Summary:**
> - **Backend:** Go (private AGG port) compiled to WebAssembly — owns all rendering, document state, pixel data, overlays
> - **Frontend:** Vite + React + TypeScript, shadcn + Tailwind CSS v4 + Base UI (headless primitives)
> - **Rule:** No pixel processing in JS/Canvas. Canvas is display-only (`putImageData`). All compositing, overlays, zoom/rotate happen in the Go/Wasm engine.
> - **ABI:** Frontend sends intents/events (pointer, keyboard, commands). Engine returns `RenderResult` (RGBA pixel buffer + UI metadata JSON).

---

## ✅ Phase 0: Scaffolding, Repo Structure, Build Pipeline — COMPLETE

- **Monorepo:** Bun workspaces — `apps/editor-web` (Vite + React + TS + Tailwind v4 + shadcn + Base UI), `packages/engine-wasm` (Go 1.25 → `js/wasm`), `packages/proto` (shared TS types/command IDs)
- **Go Wasm engine:** `syscall/js` bridge; `EngineInit` / `DispatchCommand` / `RenderFrame` / `Free` exported via `js.FuncOf`; checkerboard viewport rendered through `agg_go`; build-time version stamp via `-X buildinfo.BuildTime`
- **Frontend integration:** `loadEngine()` → `EngineContext` → `<EditorCanvas />` (`putImageData` only, zero JS pixel work)
- **Tooling:** `justfile` (`dev`, `build`, `test`, `lint`, `lint-fix`, `fmt`, `check-formatted`); `treefmt.toml` (gofumpt + gci + biome + shfmt); Biome + lefthook pre-commit; golangci-lint v2
- **CI:** GitHub Actions — reusable workflows (biome, typecheck, go-test, build) on `ubuntu-latest`
- **Licenses:** `LICENSES.md` — `agg_go` needs LICENSE before public release; GPC is non-commercial only → Clipper2 replacement is a pre-release blocker

## Phase 1: Engine Core (Document, Viewport, Pan/Zoom) + UI Shell

**Goal:** New document, pan/zoom/rotate view, status bar, basic panels.

**Acceptance criterion:** Open empty document, navigate, change zoom levels (engine renders correctly), History shows entries.

### Phase 1.1: Document & Viewport Backend

- [x] `Document`, `ViewportState`, and `DocumentManager` implemented with document metadata, viewport state, and active-document switching.
- [x] `RenderViewport(doc *Document, vp *ViewportState) []byte` implemented with AGG-backed pan/zoom/rotate rendering, backend checkerboard compositing, and `RGBA8` output.

### Phase 1.2: UI Shell & Workspace Layout

- [x] Main workspace layout implemented: menubar, toolbar, options bar, canvas, and right-side panel dock.
- [x] Panel system implemented: resizable/collapsible dock with tab groups and initial Layers, History, Properties, and Navigator panels.
- [x] Status bar (bottom): zoom %, document dimensions, cursor position (doc-space)
- [x] Canvas resize observer: fires `devicePixelRatio`-aware resize event → sends to engine
- [x] Keyboard shortcut foundation implemented with shared keymap and default pan/zoom/fit/undo/redo shortcuts.
- [x] New Document dialog implemented with presets, px/cm/in/mm sizing, DPI, color mode, bit depth, and background settings.
- [x] Navigator panel implemented with mini-viewport UI and zoom slider.

### Phase 1.3: Command System & ABI Protocol

- [x] Define command IDs in `/packages/proto/commands.ts` (enum/const map)
- [x] Define payload schemas (TypeScript interfaces): `CreateDocumentCommand`, `ZoomCommand`, `PanCommand`, `RotateViewCommand`, and related viewport/history payloads.
- [x] Go side: deserialize JSON command payloads, dispatch to engine
- [x] `RenderResult` response schema implemented with frame metadata, dirty rects, buffer references, and UI metadata.
- [x] Frontend input routing implemented: pointer events dispatch through engine commands, wheel zoom is cursor-anchored, and default browser behavior is suppressed on the canvas.
- [x] Pan tool: Space+drag pans viewport, hand tool icon
- [x] Zoom tool: click/drag zoom, `Alt`=zoom-out, scroll wheel zoom at cursor position
  - Done: zoom supports click-to-step, drag-to-scrub, `Alt` zoom-out, and cursor-anchored wheel zoom.

### Phase 1.4: Undo/Redo System

- [x] Command pattern in engine implemented with `Command`, `HistoryStack`, bounded depth, and grouped transactions for multi-step interactions.
- [x] Snapshots vs deltas: pixel-layer commands store diff (before/after dirty rect) not full copy
- [x] Dirty-rect pixel-delta history infrastructure implemented for future pixel-layer commands.
- [x] History panel UI implemented with command list, jump-to-state, and clear-history behavior.
- [x] Keyboard shortcuts: `Ctrl+Z` (undo), `Ctrl+Shift+Z` (redo), `Ctrl+Alt+Z` (step back in history)

### Phase 1.5: Dense Desktop UI Pass (Photoshop/Photopea-Inspired Shell)

**Goal:** Move the current UI shell from a spacious card layout to a dense professional editor workspace with minimal margins and padding.

**Design reference:** See `docs/ui-shell-phase-1_5-design.md`.

**Acceptance criterion:** The editor reads as a compact desktop app: contiguous top chrome, narrow tool rail, dominant canvas stage, stacked right dock panels, and visibly denser panel rows without changing the Wasm rendering architecture.

- [ ] Establish dense shell design tokens in `apps/editor-web/src/styles.css`
  - [ ] Add compact spacing, control height, radius, border, and surface tokens
  - [ ] Reduce heavy shadow/blur usage and flatten shell chrome
  - [ ] Standardize compact panel/header/tab styling primitives
- [ ] Refactor the main app frame in `apps/editor-web/src/App.tsx`
  - [ ] Convert the current large rounded shell into a contiguous application frame
  - [ ] Implement compact title/menu bar, compact options bar, and compact status bar
  - [ ] Reduce global outer padding and inter-region gaps to match dense desktop UI expectations
- [ ] Rework the left toolbar into a dense vertical tool rail
  - [ ] Tighten width, button size, button spacing, and active state styling
  - [ ] Keep tooltip/title support while removing always-visible spacious treatment
  - [ ] Reserve structure for future grouped or flyout tools
- [ ] Reframe the canvas area as an embedded stage instead of a card
  - [ ] Use a darker stage around the document and reduce decorative chrome
  - [ ] Ensure the canvas remains the dominant region at common desktop widths
  - [ ] Preserve current pan/zoom/cursor behavior and resize handling
- [ ] Rebuild the right dock into stacked software panels
  - [ ] Replace the single padded dock card with compact dock sections
  - [ ] Tighten resize affordance, header height, tabs, and body padding
  - [ ] Keep Layers, Properties, History, and Navigator usable within the denser layout
- [ ] Densify the Layers panel for editor-grade scanning
  - [ ] Reduce row height, internal padding, and gaps
  - [ ] Move toward thumbnail-first, icon-dense row composition
  - [ ] Replace large text-heavy panel actions with a compact action strip where practical
- [ ] Add shell QA and regression checks
  - [ ] Verify keyboard focus visibility across menus, toolbar, tabs, and layer rows
  - [ ] Verify layout at `1280px`, `1440px`, and `1728px+` widths
  - [ ] Verify no JS-side pixel manipulation is introduced and existing engine-driven rendering still works

---

## Phase 2: Layer System (Pixel Layer, Groups, Blend Modes, Masks) + Layers Panel

**Goal:** Photoshop foundation — multiple layers, blend modes, masks, visibility.

**Acceptance criterion:** Add/duplicate/move layers; blend modes visually correct; masks affect rendering.

### Phase 2.1: Layer Tree Data Model

- [x] `LayerNode` interface (Go):
  - [x] `ID` (UUID), `Name`, `Visible`, `Locked` (pixels/position/all)
  - [x] `Opacity` (0–1), `Fill` (0–1, separate from opacity for layer styles)
  - [x] `BlendMode` enum
  - [x] `Parent` pointer, `Children []LayerNode` (for groups)
  - [x] `Mask *LayerMask`, `VectorMask *Path`, `ClippingBase bool`
  - [x] `StyleStack []LayerStyle`
- [x] Layer types implementing `LayerNode`:
  - [x] `PixelLayer`: raw RGBA pixel buffer, bounds (x/y offset within doc)
  - [x] `GroupLayer`: contains children, pass-through or isolated blend
  - [x] `AdjustmentLayer`: params only, no pixel data (Phase 5)
  - [x] `TextLayer`: text params + cached raster (Phase 6)
  - [x] `VectorLayer`: path + fill/stroke params + cached raster (Phase 6)
- [x] Layer operations:
  - [x] `AddLayer`, `DeleteLayer`, `DuplicateLayer`, `MoveLayer` (reorder in tree)
  - [x] `SetVisibility`, `SetOpacity`, `SetBlendMode`, `SetLock`
  - [x] `FlattenLayer`, `MergeDown`, `MergeVisible`
- [x] All operations go through history (undo-able)

### Phase 2.2: Blend Modes & Compositing

- [x] Implement full blend mode set (Porter-Duff + Photoshop blend formulas):
  - [x] **Normal group:** Normal, Dissolve
  - [x] **Darkening:** Multiply, Color Burn, Linear Burn, Darken, Darker Color
  - [x] **Lightening:** Screen, Color Dodge, Linear Dodge (Add), Lighten, Lighter Color
  - [x] **Contrast:** Overlay, Soft Light, Hard Light, Vivid Light, Linear Light, Pin Light, Hard Mix
  - [x] **Inversion:** Difference, Exclusion, Subtract, Divide
  - [x] **Component:** Hue, Saturation, Color, Luminosity
- [x] Compositing pipeline:
  - [x] Walk layer tree bottom-to-top
  - [x] Apply blend mode formulas and composite each layer onto the accumulator
  - [x] Apply layer masks during compositing
  - [x] Group layers: composite children into isolated buffer, then composite group onto parent
  - [x] Pass-through groups: children blend directly into parent context
  - [x] Clipping mask: clip layer's alpha to base layer's alpha
- [x] Performance: cache layer composites; invalidate only when layer or ancestors change
- [x] Write golden-image unit tests for each blend mode formula

### Phase 2.3: Layer Masks

- [x] Raster layer mask:
  - [x] Grayscale 8-bit buffer (same size as document, white=reveal, black=hide)
  - [x] Operations: `AddMask(revealAll/hideAll/fromSelection)`, `DeleteMask`, `ApplyMask`, `InvertMask`
  - [x] Edit mask: painting on mask activates mask-edit mode (border indicator in UI)
  - [x] Disable/enable mask (Shift+click thumbnail in Layers panel)
- [x] Clipping mask:
  - [x] `ClipToBelow bool` flag on layer
  - [x] Compositing: clipped layer alpha *= base layer alpha
  - [x] Visual indent in Layers panel for clipped layers
- [x] Vector mask placeholder:
  - [x] `VectorMask *Path` field (renders to raster mask at composite time)
  - [x] Full implementation deferred to Phase 6.1

### Phase 2.4: Layers Panel UI

- [x] Tree view:
  - [x] Nested rows for groups (collapsible with arrow toggle)
  - [x] Layer thumbnail (canvas-rendered RGBA preview; engine returns 32×32 via GetLayerThumbnails command, updated on ContentVersion change)
  - [x] Mask thumbnail next to layer thumbnail (grayscale mask rendered to RGBA canvas, clickable to enter mask-edit mode)
  - [x] Layer name (double-click to rename inline)
- [x] Controls per layer row:
  - [x] Visibility eye icon (click to toggle, Alt+click to solo)
  - [x] Lock icon (click → cycle none/pixels/position/all)
  - [x] Blend mode dropdown (all 27 modes in grouped optgroups)
  - [x] Opacity slider/input (0–100%)
  - [x] Fill opacity slider/input (0–100%)
- [x] Panel toolbar: New Layer, New Group, Add Mask, Delete Layer, Merge Down
- [x] Context menu (right-click on layer):
  - [x] Duplicate Layer, Delete Layer, Merge Down, Merge Visible, Flatten Image
  - [x] Group Layers, Ungroup
  - [x] Add Layer Mask (Reveal All / Hide All / From Selection)
  - [x] Add Clipping Mask / Release Clipping Mask
  - [x] Layer Properties (rename + color tag — UI-only color labels, 8 colours)
- [x] Drag-and-drop reordering within the tree
- [x] Multi-select (Shift/Ctrl+click) for bulk operations
- [x] Channels panel stub (RGB + Alpha channels with per-channel visibility toggles, view only)

### Phase 2.5: Internal Project Save/Load

- [x] Define internal project format (`.agp` — Agogo Project):
  - [x] JSON manifest: document metadata, layer tree structure, blend modes, masks config, history metadata
  - [x] Binary blobs: pixel data per layer (raw RGBA, deflate-compressed via ZIP)
  - [x] Packaged as ZIP (JSON + blobs in single file, easy to inspect)
- [x] `SaveProject(doc) -> []byte`: serialize to `.agp`
- [x] `LoadProject([]byte) -> Document`: deserialize from `.agp`
- [x] File > Save / Save As (browser file system API / download)
- [x] File > Open (file picker, drag & drop onto canvas)
- [x] Auto-save to `localStorage` (every N commands, configurable)
- [x] Recovery on next open if auto-save present

## Phase 3: Selection & Transform (Move, Marquee/Lasso, Free Transform, Crop)

**Goal:** Photoshop-like interaction — select, move, transform, crop.

**Acceptance criterion:** Select areas, move layers, transform; UI stays responsive.

### Phase 3.1: Selection Engine (Backend)

- [ ] `Selection` type: 8-bit alpha mask in document-space (`W × H` bytes, 0=transparent, 255=fully selected)
- [ ] Selection operations:
  - [ ] `New(rect/ellipse/polygon)` — creates new selection
  - [ ] `Add` (Shift modifier), `Subtract` (Alt modifier), `Intersect` (Shift+Alt)
  - [ ] `SelectAll`, `Deselect`, `Reselect` (reloads last selection)
  - [ ] `Invert` — flips mask
- [ ] Selection modification commands:
  - [ ] `Feather(radius float)` — Gaussian blur on mask
  - [ ] `Expand(px int)`, `Contract(px int)` — morphological dilation/erosion
  - [ ] `Smooth(radius int)` — median-like smoothing on mask edges
  - [ ] `Border(width int)` — select only the border band
  - [ ] `TransformSelection` — free-transform the selection shape itself (not content)
- [ ] Marching ants overlay:
  - [ ] Backend renders animated dashed line border of selection
  - [ ] `RenderSelectionOverlay(selection, viewport) -> []byte` composited into viewport output
  - [ ] Animation frame counter incremented per render call
- [ ] Color Range selection:
  - [ ] `SelectColorRange(doc, layer, targetColor, fuzziness) -> Selection`
- [ ] Quick Selection (flood-fill with edge detection) — foundation for Phase 3.2

### Phase 3.2: Selection Tools

- [ ] **Marquee tools:**
  - [ ] Rectangular Marquee: click-drag bounding box
  - [ ] Elliptical Marquee: click-drag with AA edge

    - [ ] Reference point grid (Photoshop-style)
  - [ ] Operations:
    - [ ] **Scale:** drag corner/edge handles (Shift=constrain proportions)
    - [ ] **Rotate:** drag outside bounding box (Shift=snap to 15° increments)
    - [ ] **Move:** drag inside bounding box
    - [ ] **Skew:** `Ctrl+drag` edge handle
    - [ ] **Distort:** `Ctrl+drag` corner handle (free distort, no constraint)
    - [ ] **Perspective:** `Ctrl+Shift+Alt+drag` corner (perspective warp)
    - [ ] **Warp:** grid-based mesh warp (subdivide bounding box into grid, drag control points)
  - [ ] Numeric input in Options bar: X, Y, W, H, rotation angle, skew H/V, with lock-aspect checkbox
  - [ ] Commit: Enter or double-click; Cancel: Escape
  - [ ] Interpolation mode for pixel layers: Nearest Neighbor, Bilinear, Bicubic (Smoother/Sharper)
- [ ] Transform on selection content:
  - [ ] Floating selection: selected pixels become a temporary floating layer during transform
  - [ ] Merge back on commit
- [ ] **Edit > Transform sub-menu:**
  - [ ] Scale, Rotate, Skew, Distort, Perspective, Warp, Flip Horizontal/Vertical
  - [ ] Rotate 90° CW/CCW, 180°

  - [ ] Darkened area outside crop box
  - [ ] Rule-of-thirds grid overlay inside crop box (optional, configurable)
  - [ ] 8 resize handles on crop box
- [ ] Operations:
  - [ ] Resize crop box (drag handles)
  - [ ] Move crop box (drag inside)
  - [ ] Rotate crop box (drag outside — rotates the canvas, not just view)
  - [ ] Constrain aspect ratio (lock icon in options bar, or W:H input)
- [ ] Options bar: width/height inputs, resolution, straighten (horizon correction), overlay type, delete cropped pixels vs hide
- [ ] Commit (Enter) / Cancel (Escape)
- [ ] Content-Aware Fill for crop expansion (later/optional, Phase 7+)
- [ ] **Image > Canvas Size:** resize canvas independently of content, with anchor grid

---

## Phase 4: Painting Basics (Brush/Pencil/Eraser/Fill/Gradient) + Brush UI

**Goal:** Painting and basic retouch foundation.

**Acceptance criterion:** Draw on pixel layers; Undo works; engine renders strokes.

### Phase 4.1: Brush Engine (Backend)

- [ ] Dab rasterization via AGG:
  - [ ] Circular dab with configurable `size`, `hardness` (soft/hard edge via AGG AA rendering)
  - [ ] Subpixel placement (AGG affine transform for fractional-pixel positioning)
  - [ ] Alpha compositing of dab onto layer buffer with `flow` (per-dab alpha) and `opacity` (cumulative stroke cap)
- [ ] Stroke generation:
  - [ ] Dab spacing as percentage of brush size (e.g. 25% = default)
  - [ ] Interpolate dab positions along pointer path (catmull-rom for smoothness)
  - [ ] Wet edges mode (accumulate at edges)
- [ ] Brush dynamics:
  - [ ] Pressure sensitivity: size, opacity, flow mapped from `PointerEvent.pressure` (0–1)
  - [ ] Tilt sensitivity: direction mapping from `tiltX/tiltY` (Phase 4.1b)
  - [ ] Jitter/scatter: random offset per dab (Phase 4.1b)
- [ ] Stabilizer: weighted average of last N input points before finalizing position (configurable lag)
- [ ] Blend modes for brush: all standard modes (paint directly with blend mode, not just Normal)
- [ ] Sample merged option: eyedropper mode during painting

### Phase 4.2: Paint Tools

- [ ] **Brush Tool (B):**
  - [ ] Uses full brush engine (size, hardness, flow, opacity, spacing, dynamics)
  - [ ] Paints with foreground color
  - [ ] Shortcut: `[`/`]` resize, `Shift+[`/`]` hardness
- [ ] **Pencil Tool:**
  - [ ] Hard-edge dabs only (no anti-aliasing), `hardness` locked to 100%

    - [ ] Color stops (add/remove/move)
    - [ ] Opacity stops
    - [ ] Reverse checkbox, dither checkbox
    - [ ] Gradient presets (save/load)
  - [ ] Apply: drag to set direction and length; respects selection
  - [ ] Modes: paint over layer, create fill layer (non-destructive gradient fill layer type)
- [ ] **Eyedropper Tool (I):**
  - [ ] Click to sample foreground color
  - [ ] Alt+click to sample background color
  - [ ] Sample size: point / 3×3 avg / 5×5 avg / 11×11 avg / 31×31 avg / 51×51 avg / 101×101 avg
  - [ ] Sample: current layer / all layers / all layers no adj
  - [ ] Color sampler points: place up to 4 persistent sample points (shown in Info panel)

## Phase 5: Adjustments & Filter System (Non-Destructive) + Properties/Adjustments Panel

**Goal:** Photo editing core — tonal corrections, curves, hue/sat as non-destructive adjustment layers; filter pipeline.

**Acceptance criterion:** Adjustment layers work non-destructively; core filters run; live preview updates.

### Phase 5.1: Adjustment Layer Framework

- [ ] `AdjustmentLayer` base type:
  - [ ] `Type` enum (Levels, Curves, HueSat, ColorBalance, etc.)
  - [ ] `Params` (JSON-serializable, type-specific struct)
  - [ ] `Mask *LayerMask` (optional — restrict adjustment to masked area)
  - [ ] `Clip bool` (clip to layer below, like any layer)
- [ ] Render pipeline integration:
  - [ ] Before compositing a layer, walk up the stack to apply all adjustment layers above it (that are clipped or affect the composite group)
  - [ ] Apply adjustment as a pixel-space color transform function: `adjustPixel(r, g, b, a, params) -> (r, g, b, a)`
  - [ ] Cache adjustment result per dirty region; invalidate only when params or input change
- [ ] Invalidation propagation:
  - [ ] Change to adjustment layer params → re-render all layers below in the composite
  - [ ] Upstream invalidation: only dirty the region that needs re-compositing
- [ ] Non-destructive guarantee: deleting or hiding adjustment layer returns composite to original state
- [ ] Serialize/deserialize adjustment params in `.agp` format

### Phase 5.2: Core Adjustment Layers

- [ ] **Levels:**
  - [ ] Input black point, white point, midtone gamma (per channel: R/G/B/RGB)
  - [ ] Output black point, white point
  - [ ] Auto-calculate (stretch to full range), Auto Options (clipping %)
  - [ ] Histogram display inside properties panel
- [ ] **Curves:**
  - [ ] Curve editor: click+drag to add/move control points on the curve
  - [ ] Per channel: RGB composite + R/G/B individual
  - [ ] Input/Output numeric readout at cursor
  - [ ] Presets (save/load named curves)
  - [ ] Eyedropper: click image to set black/white/gray point from sample
- [ ] **Hue/Saturation:**
  - [ ] Master + per-color-range (Reds, Yellows, Greens, Cyans, Blues, Magentas)
  - [ ] Hue shift (−180 to +180), Saturation (−100 to +100), Lightness (−100 to +100)
  - [ ] Colorize mode (monochromatic)
  - [ ] Color range selector eyedropper (click color in image to target that range)
- [ ] **Color Balance:**
  - [ ] Shadows, Midtones, Highlights sliders (Cyan-Red, Magenta-Green, Yellow-Blue)
  - [ ] Preserve Luminosity checkbox
- [ ] **Brightness/Contrast:**
  - [ ] Simple Brightness (−150 to +150), Contrast (−50 to +100)
  - [ ] Legacy mode checkbox
- [ ] **Exposure:**
  - [ ] Exposure (f-stops), Offset, Gamma Correction
- [ ] **Vibrance:**
  - [ ] Vibrance (smart saturation boost), Saturation
- [ ] **Black & White:**
  - [ ] Six color-range sliders (Reds/Yellows/Greens/Cyans/Blues/Magentas)
  - [ ] Auto, Tint option (adds color overlay on grayscale)

### Phase 5.3: Extended Adjustment Layers

- [ ] **Gradient Map:** map luminance to gradient stops (reuse gradient editor from Phase 4.3)
- [ ] **Invert:** flip all channels (`255 - v`)
- [ ] **Threshold:** convert to 1-bit (adjustable threshold slider)
- [ ] **Posterize:** reduce tonal levels per channel (slider 2–255)
- [ ] **Channel Mixer:** custom mix of channels into output channels; monochrome output mode
- [ ] **Selective Color:** adjust CMY+K per named color range (Reds, Yellows, Greens, Cyans, Blues, Magentas, Whites, Neutrals, Blacks); Relative/Absolute mode
- [ ] **Photo Filter:** simulate gel color filter (color picker + density slider, preserve luminosity)

### Phase 5.4: Filter Framework

- [ ] Filter registry:
  - [ ] Each filter: `ID`, `Name`, `Category`, `HasDialog bool`, `Apply(layer, params, selection) -> modified_layer`
  - [ ] Category menu structure: Blur, Sharpen, Noise, Distort, Stylize, Render, Other
- [ ] Filter dialog system:
  - [ ] Immediate filters: apply directly (e.g. Invert)
  - [ ] Dialog filters: open parameter dialog with live preview before committing
  - [ ] Preview: backend renders filter preview at reduced resolution for speed
  - [ ] "Last Filter" shortcut (`Ctrl+F`) to re-apply last used filter with same params
  - [ ] `Filter > Fade` after applying: blend filtered result with original (opacity + blend mode)
- [ ] Filter applied destructively to pixel layer (vs Smart Filter on Smart Objects — Phase 7+)
- [ ] Smart Filter placeholder: if layer is Smart Object, filter is stored non-destructively in style stack

### Phase 5.5: Core Filters

- [ ] **Blur category:**
  - [ ] Gaussian Blur: `radius` (float), uses AGG or pure Go convolution

## Phase 7: PSD/PSB Compatibility, Artboards, Slices, Automation

**Goal:** Photopea-level feature set — PSD as native format, artboards/slices/actions.

**Acceptance criterion:** Open/save PSD (subset) works; slices/artboards export; actions/variables run rudimentarily.

### Phase 7.1: PSD Parser (Read)

- [ ] Implement PSD/PSB file format reader per Adobe specification:
  - [ ] **File header:** magic (`8BPS`), version (1=PSD, 2=PSB), channels, height, width, depth, color mode
  - [ ] **Color mode data section**
  - [ ] **Image resources section:** parse key resources — DPI (0x03ED), ICC profile (0x040F), guides (0x0408), slices (0x041A), layer comps (0x0435)
  - [ ] **Layer and mask information section:**
    - [ ] Layer count, layer records (bounding rect, channels, blend mode, opacity, flags, name, extra data)
    - [ ] Extra layer data: layer name (Unicode), layer ID, layer color tag, sections (groups/begin-end markers)
    - [ ] Layer masks: mask data per layer
    - [ ] Layer effects (legacy effects list + object-based effects / descriptor)
    - [ ] Text layer data (descriptor-based: TySh)
    - [ ] Vector mask data (vmsk / vsms)
    - [ ] Adjustment layer params per type (leve, curv, hue2, etc.)
    - [ ] Smart object data (PlLd, SoLd, lsct descriptors)
  - [ ] **Image data section:** channel pixel data (raw, RLE, zip with/without prediction)
  - [ ] PSB differences: 4-byte length fields, 8-byte channel data lengths, extended limits
- [ ] Map parsed data to internal `Document` / `LayerNode` tree
- [ ] Fallback: unknown layer types import as flattened pixel layer with warning
- [ ] Error handling: corrupt/partial PSDs load what they can, report issues

### Phase 7.2: PSD Writer (Save)

- [ ] Serialize internal document to PSD/PSB byte stream:
  - [ ] Write file header
  - [ ] Serialize all image resources
  - [ ] Serialize layer tree (order, bounding rects, pixel data, blend mode, opacity)
  - [ ] Serialize masks per layer
  - [ ] Serialize layer effects as descriptors
  - [ ] Serialize text layers as TySh descriptors
  - [ ] Serialize adjustment layer params
  - [ ] Serialize merged image data (composite of all visible layers)
  - [ ] RLE compression for pixel data (PackBits)
- [ ] Round-trip test: open PSD → modify → save → re-open, verify no loss for supported features
- [ ] PSB write for documents exceeding PSD limits (30,000px)
- [ ] Save as PSD / Save as PSB in File menu

### Phase 7.3: Artboards

- [ ] **Artboard data model:**
  - [ ] An artboard is a special `GroupLayer` with a fixed rectangular bounds in doc-space
  - [ ] Document can contain multiple artboards (or none — traditional document)
  - [ ] Artboard has its own background color
  - [ ] Artboards are visible as labeled frames on the canvas; content outside bounds is clipped during export
- [ ] **Artboard tool:**
  - [ ] Create artboard: drag on canvas (similar to shape tool)
  - [ ] Resize artboard: drag handles (like free transform)
  - [ ] Move artboard with content
  - [ ] Preset sizes: iPhone, iPad, Desktop, Custom
- [ ] **Artboards Panel / Layers Panel integration:**
  - [ ] Artboards appear as top-level groups with special icon
  - [ ] Layers inside artboards are children
- [ ] **Export artboards:**
  - [ ] File > Export > Artboards to Files → choose format (PNG/JPG/PDF), naming, destination
  - [ ] File > Export > Artboards to ZIP
  - [ ] Per-artboard scale variants (1x, 2x, 3x)

### Phase 7.4: Slices

- [ ] **Slice data model:**
  - [ ] `Slice`: rect (x, y, w, h) in doc-space, name, URL, alt text, export settings
  - [ ] Slice types: user-created, layer-based (auto from layer bounds), auto (fill space between user slices)
- [ ] **Slice Tool (C):**
  - [ ] Drag to create user slice
  - [ ] Slices shown as numbered rectangles with labels
  - [ ] Slice Select Tool: click to select, resize, move
  - [ ] Divide Slice: split into N rows/columns
  - [ ] Delete Slice
- [ ] **Slice Options (double-click):**
  - [ ] Name, URL, Target, Alt, Message, dimensions (numeric)
  - [ ] Export format override per slice (PNG/JPG/GIF, quality)
- [ ] **Export slices:**
  - [ ] File > Export > Save for Web (slices tab): preview all slices, adjust formats
  - [ ] File > Export > Slices to Files → folder + naming pattern
  - [ ] Layer-based slices: `Layer > New Layer Based Slice` auto-creates slice from layer bounds
- [ ] View > Show Slices toggle (on/off overlay)

### Phase 7.5: Actions / Automation

- [ ] **Action data model:**
  - [ ] `Action`: name, list of `ActionStep`s
  - [ ] `ActionStep`: `commandID`, serialized params (same command protocol as regular commands)
  - [ ] `ActionSet`: named group of actions
- [ ] **Record mode:**
  - [ ] Start recording: all subsequent commands are appended to current action
  - [ ] Stop recording
  - [ ] Recorded steps shown in Actions panel in real-time
  - [ ] Edit individual step params (double-click step)
  - [ ] Toggle modal/non-modal per step (dialogs stop playback or auto-confirm)
- [ ] **Play action:**
  - [ ] Play from beginning or from selected step
  - [ ] Step-through mode (pause after each step for review)
  - [ ] Playback speed controls
- [ ] **Batch processing:**
  - [ ] File > Automate > Batch: select action set + action, source (folder), destination (folder/same/save&close), naming pattern
  - [ ] Process list of files through browser File System Access API
- [ ] **Actions Panel UI:**
  - [ ] Accordion list of action sets > actions > steps
  - [ ] Record button (red), Stop, Play, New Action, New Set, Delete, duplicate
  - [ ] Step enable/disable checkboxes
  - [ ] Import/Export actions as `.atn` (Adobe format — best-effort parsing)

### Phase 7.6: Variables & Data Sets

- [ ] **Variables data model:**
  - [ ] Variables defined per document, bound to specific layers
  - [ ] Variable types: Text Replacement (replaces text layer content), Pixel Replacement (replaces pixel layer image), Visibility (show/hide layer)
  - [ ] Data sets: each data set is a row — maps variable names to values
- [ ] **Variables dialog (File > Variables):**
  - [ ] Tab 1 — Define: create/delete variables, bind to layers, set type
  - [ ] Tab 2 — Data Sets: import CSV, edit rows, preview
- [ ] **Export data sets:**
  - [ ] Iterate over data sets: substitute variables, export each variant as image
  - [ ] Output: individual files with naming from data set column

### Phase 7.7: Scripting

- [ ] **Script console panel:**
  - [ ] Text input area for script commands
  - [ ] Output/log area
- [ ] **Script model:**
  - [ ] Expose global `app` object to scripts (similar to Photoshop/Photopea scripting API)
  - [ ] `app.activeDocument`: Document properties
  - [ ] `app.activeDocument.activeLayer`: Layer operations
  - [ ] Available methods: `addLayer`, `deleteLayer`, `setLayerBlendMode`, `applyFilter`, etc.
  - [ ] Scripts are sequences of calls to the same command protocol (macro over the command bus)
- [ ] **Import/run scripts:** File > Scripts > Browse (file picker for `.js` script files)
- [ ] **Bundled scripts:** File > Scripts > built-in utilities (e.g. "Export Layers to Files")

## Phase 8: Performance Hardening (Worker, Dirty Rects, Caches) + Pro UX

**Goal:** Professional-feeling editor — no jank, large files, fast tools.

**Acceptance criterion:** Large documents remain navigable; brush strokes feel fluid; UI thread never blocks.

### Phase 8.1: Web Worker Migration

- [ ] Move Wasm engine instantiation and execution to a `Worker`:
  - [ ] Worker file: `engine.worker.ts` — loads Wasm, runs event loop
  - [ ] Main thread ↔ Worker communication via `postMessage` / `MessageChannel`
- [ ] Stabilize message protocol:
  - [ ] Commands: serialize to `Uint8Array` (binary command packets) — avoid JSON for hot path
  - [ ] Responses: `RenderResult` with `Transferable` pixel buffer (`ArrayBuffer.transfer`)
  - [ ] Control messages: ping/pong, worker-ready, error
- [ ] UI thread never blocks on engine:
  - [ ] All engine calls are async (fire-and-forget commands, receive rendered frames when ready)
  - [ ] Decouple input rate from render rate (engine can render at lower FPS than pointer events arrive)
- [ ] Frame pipeline:
  - [ ] Input collector: accumulates pointer events between frames
  - [ ] Frame request: send accumulated commands, request new render
  - [ ] Frame receive: apply `putImageData` on `requestAnimationFrame`
  - [ ] Back-pressure: don't queue more than N outstanding render requests

### Phase 8.2: Dirty Rect Rendering

- [ ] Engine tracks dirty rectangles:
  - [ ] Brush stroke: bounding box of new dabs in this command
  - [ ] Transform: pre+post transform bounding box union
  - [ ] Adjustment change: affected layer bounds
  - [ ] Union of all dirtied rects for the frame
- [ ] Backend returns `dirtyRects[]` in `RenderResult` (already in protocol)
- [ ] Frontend: only re-blit dirty regions via `ctx.putImageData(imageData, dx, dy, dirtyX, dirtyY, dirtyW, dirtyH)`
- [ ] Compositor: only re-render dirty region (skip unchanged tiles/layers)
- [ ] Benchmark: measure fps improvement on large canvases with small stroke areas

### Phase 8.3: SharedArrayBuffer & Zero-Copy (Optional Optimization)

- [ ] Set up cross-origin isolation (required for SharedArrayBuffer):
  - [ ] Configure server/hosting with headers: `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin`, `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp`
  - [ ] Service Worker approach as fallback for hosts that don't support custom headers
  - [ ] Verify isolation: `crossOriginIsolated === true` in browser
- [ ] SharedArrayBuffer ring buffer:
  - [ ] Allocate SAB for pixel output (sized to max canvas dimensions)
  - [ ] Ring buffer with write-head and read-head pointers (also in SAB)
  - [ ] Worker writes completed frame to SAB, increments write head
  - [ ] UI thread reads from SAB on RAF, no copy needed
- [ ] Frame fences:
  - [ ] Use `Atomics.wait` / `Atomics.notify` for synchronization
  - [ ] Frame ID in SAB header for stale-frame detection
- [ ] Fallback: if `crossOriginIsolated` is false, fall back to Transferable ArrayBuffer mode

### Phase 8.4: Multi-Resolution & Tile Cache

- [ ] Downscale pyramid (mipmaps) in backend:
  - [ ] For each pixel layer, maintain pre-computed lower-resolution versions
  - [ ] Update pyramid tiles only in regions touched by edits
  - [ ] Zoom-out rendering uses appropriate pyramid level (avoids reading all pixels)
- [ ] Tile-based rendering:
  - [ ] Divide canvas output into tiles (e.g. 256×256 device pixels)
  - [ ] Track per-tile dirty state; only re-composite dirty tiles
  - [ ] Viewport render: union dirty tiles in view frustum
- [ ] Layer cache:
  - [ ] Cache composited result of sub-trees that haven't changed
  - [ ] Smart Object cache: cache rendered smart object at multiple resolutions
- [ ] Memory budget:
  - [ ] LRU cache eviction for layer and pyramid caches
  - [ ] Configurable max cache size (user preference)

### Phase 8.5: Pro UX Features

- [ ] **Guides and Rulers:**
  - [ ] Ruler display (horizontal + vertical, draggable origin corner)
  - [ ] Units: px/pt/cm/mm/in/percent (configurable per doc)
  - [ ] Drag guides from ruler edge; drag to reposition; double-click to set exact position
  - [ ] Lock guides, clear all guides
  - [ ] Smart guides: snap to edges/centers of other layers (live feedback lines rendered in backend overlay)
- [ ] **Grid:**
  - [ ] Show/hide grid (View > Show > Grid)
  - [ ] Grid color, style, spacing — all configurable in Preferences
  - [ ] Snap to Grid
- [ ] **Snap system:**
  - [ ] Snap targets: guides, grid, layer edges, layer centers, document edges, artboard edges, slices
  - [ ] Toggle each snap type independently (View > Snap To)
  - [ ] Snap threshold in pixels
- [ ] **Histogram Panel:** live histogram of current document composite or active layer (R/G/B/A/Luminosity channels, switchable)
- [ ] **Info Panel:** cursor position (doc-space), color readout at cursor (mode-dependent), document size, selection dimensions, transform feedback
- [ ] **Keyboard Shortcut Customizer:**
  - [ ] File > Keyboard Shortcuts dialog
  - [ ] Browse all commands by menu/panel
  - [ ] Click a command row → press new key combination
  - [ ] Conflict detection with warning
  - [ ] Save named shortcut set, load preset (Photoshop-like defaults)
  - [ ] Export shortcuts as PDF/reference sheet
- [ ] **Workspace Presets:**
  - [ ] Window > Workspace: Essentials, Photography, Typography, Painting, Custom
  - [ ] Save current panel layout + keyboard shortcuts as named workspace
  - [ ] Reset to saved workspace
- [ ] **Preferences dialog** (Edit > Preferences):
  - [ ] UI: theme (dark/medium dark/light/medium light), language, font size
  - [ ] Performance: history states count, cache levels, tile size
  - [ ] Guides & Grid: colors, style, subdivision
  - [ ] File Handling: auto-save interval, recovery location
  - [ ] Rulers & Units: ruler units, column size
- [ ] **Fullscreen mode:** hide all UI chrome, canvas fills browser window (Ctrl+Shift+F)
- [ ] **Tab bar for multiple open documents:** each document in a tab, drag to reorder

---

## Quality, Testing, Build & Deployment

### Testing Strategy

- [ ] **Go Engine Unit Tests:**
  - [ ] Blend mode formulas: input/output pairs for each mode (compare to known-correct values)
  - [ ] Selection ops: add/subtract/intersect/feather — golden image masks
  - [ ] Filter kernels: Gaussian, Unsharp Mask — compare output buffers (within epsilon)
  - [ ] Adjustment layers: Levels/Curves/HueSat — compare pixel transforms
  - [ ] PSD parser: known PSD files → parse → re-serialize → compare bytes
  - [ ] AGG path rasterization: known paths → compare rendered alpha masks

- [ ] **Deterministic Render Tests:**
  - [ ] Snapshot test: `RenderViewport(doc, vp)` → SHA256 hash stored as golden
  - [ ] CI fails on hash mismatch (flag intentional changes by updating goldens explicitly)
  - [ ] Test fixtures: minimal documents with 1–5 layers covering each layer type

- [ ] **ABI Stability / Interop Tests:**
  - [ ] Run Wasm via Node.js (`node --experimental-wasm-...` or standard Node 20+)
  - [ ] Test: JS calls `EngineInit` → `CreateDocument` → `RenderViewport` → `Free`; verify no memory leaks
  - [ ] Test: command round-trip (serialize TS payload → Go deserialize → verify fields)

- [ ] **E2E Tests (Playwright):**
  - [ ] Open editor → create new document → paint stroke → undo → redo → export PNG → compare hash
  - [ ] Open PSD fixture → verify layer count + names → render → compare screenshot
  - [ ] Apply adjustment layer → verify visual change
  - [ ] Text tool → type text → commit → verify text rendered in export
  - [ ] Run via CI on Chromium headless

### Build & Release

- [ ] **Production builds:**
  - [ ] Frontend: `vite build` with code splitting, tree-shaking
  - [ ] Wasm: `go build` with optimization flags (`-ldflags="-s -w"`, `tinygo` consideration for size)
  - [ ] Wasm compression: Brotli pre-compressed + gzip fallback; server configured to serve with `Content-Encoding`
  - [ ] Bundle size budget: track JS bundle and Wasm size in CI (fail if exceeds threshold)
- [ ] **Version stamping:**
  - [ ] Embed build-time version in Wasm binary (`go:embed` or linker flag)
  - [ ] Frontend version from `package.json` + git short SHA
  - [ ] Version displayed in Help > About and diagnostics panel
- [ ] **Feature flags:**
  - [ ] Runtime flag system for beta features (Liquify, Smart Objects, CMYK mode, RAW import)
  - [ ] Flags configurable via URL param (`?flags=liquify,smart-objects`) or settings

### Deployment & Security Headers

- [ ] Configure hosting with required headers:
  - [ ] `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin`
  - [ ] `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp`
  - [ ] (Required for SharedArrayBuffer and Wasm Threads)
- [ ] Verify `crossOriginIsolated === true` in deployed app
- [ ] Service Worker COOP/COEP header injection fallback (for hosts without custom headers)
- [ ] CSP (Content Security Policy) — allow Wasm eval, no inline scripts

### License & Third-Party Audit

- [ ] **AGG:** determine exact version/fork; replace any GPL components if commercial use intended
- [ ] **GPC (General Polygon Clipper):** non-commercial only — replace with alternative (e.g. Clipper2 / Polyclipping library with permissive license) before any commercial deployment
- [ ] **Fonts:** verify EULA for any bundled fonts; use OFL or custom-licensed fonts only
- [ ] **PSD/PSB Specification:** Adobe spec is publicly accessible; parser is clean-room
- [ ] **RAW decoding:** patent/licensing review before implementing RAW support
- [ ] Document all third-party dependencies and licenses in `THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.md`
- [ ] Run `go licenses` and `license-checker` (npm) in CI

---

## Deferred / Later Features (Post-Phase 8)

These are explicitly out of scope for Phases 0–8 but should be planned for:

- **Liquify filter** (mesh-warp, forward warp, reconstruct, smear — very complex, needs special UI)
- **Vanishing Point** (3D plane definition + perspective-correct clone/paste)
- **Smart Objects** (embedded documents, non-destructive transforms, linked Smart Objects from disk)
- **Smart Filters** (non-destructive filter stack on Smart Objects)
- **CMYK / Lab color modes** (needs ICC color profile management)
- **16-bit and 32-bit per channel** editing
- **RAW file support** (dcraw-like decoder or LibRaw port)
- **Healing Brush / Spot Healing / Content-Aware Fill** (complex inpainting algorithms)
- **Content-Aware Scale** (seam carving)
- **Mixer Brush** (wet paint simulation)
- **3D features** (very late / optional)
- **Oil Paint filter** (GPU-required in Photoshop; in Wasm requires heavy CPU implementation)
- **Wasm Threads** (requires full COOP/COEP deployment, complex parallelism)
- **Offline PWA** (Service Worker cache, offline-first)
- **Cloud storage / autosave to server**
- **Collaboration / multiplayer**
- **AI-assisted selection** (Subject Select, Remove Background via ML model in Wasm)
